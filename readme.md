## Repository structure

- **api.py**: Provide API through Flask and Gunicorn Interface, allowing remote users to call the fine-tuned large model.
- **cli_demo.py**: Provides a command line interface, users can interact with the model directly through the command line.
- **web_demo.py**: Uses Gradio to create a web interface, allowing users to interact with the model through a browser.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of dependency packages required for the project.

## Environment Setup

First, make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed.

### Install dependencies

Run the following command in the project root directory to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage instructions

### Interact through the API
api.py provides a RESTful API based on Flask and Gunicorn, which can be started as follows:

```bash
gunicorn -w 1 -b 0.0.0.0:6006 api:app
```
After the server is started, the API will run at http://localhost:6006, and you can call it through curl or other tools.

### Interact through the command line
Run cli_demo.py to interact with the model through the command line:

```bash
python cli_demo.py
```
You can add different input options in the command line according to your needs.

### Interacting via the web interface
Run web_demo.py to start the Gradio-based web interface:
```bash
python web_demo.py
```

Once started, your browser will automatically open the Gradio web application, allowing you to interact with the model through a graphical interface.
